# ðŸ˜Ž Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

Heart failure is a major concern of all time because it is a sudden event. Research took a dataset which has approximately a thousand number of samples and various attributes such as hypertension, diabetes, mental health, pacemaker, history of stroke and other various ailments. So the model tries to sort out the dataset in manner to be effective with algorithms. Numerous machine learning algorithms are experimented and out of those algorithms some algorithms such as Catboost, Adaboost, and Support vector classifier are selected which are giving high accuracy. Model came across with exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing and data visualization.

#### About Dataset

The Heart failure dataset is a kind of clinically tested dataset having some sample records of patients to classify them between patients, having heart failure disease, will end in death or survive. As per the brief information and visuals, the dataset states that it contains around 1000 sample records that are described by 31 attributes among which 30 attributes described patientsâ€™ personal details as well as any kind of diseases they have  gone through in past time, clinically tested by doctors. The attributes that describe patientsâ€™ overall details are, some, present in categorical form and some are in continuous form.
